            <p id="infoText">The University of Computer Studies,Yangon (UCSY) is one of the higher institutions under
                the Ministry of Science and Technology. UCSY is to conduct teaching and research in various branches of
                computer science, computer technology, and information technology. To meet the growing need for general
                and advanced computer education in Myanmar, the university currently offers both undergraduate and
                postgraduate degrees. Its language of instruction is English. <br>

                Bachelor degrees were started in 1986 but Master degrees were offered in 1973. In May 2001, the Ph.D.
                program was started. For all study programs, each academic year is divided into two terms. Each term has
                18 weeks for teaching and practical. Examinations are conducted during the end of each term. Clear
                attendance, tutorials and practical, class assignments are taken into account as components of the
                assessment.</p>
