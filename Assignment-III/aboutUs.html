                    computer science, computer technology, and information technology. To meet the growing need for
                    general and advanced computer education in Myanmar, the university currently offers both
                    undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Its language of instruction is English.

                    term. Clear attendance, tutorials and practical, class assignments are taken into account as
                    components of the assessment.</p>
